I created a Github repo Corona.\n Ternary plot 5 most infected countries  In the process of improving the labeling I had to update ggplot2 to version 3.3. This broke ggtern. As it wasn\u0026rsquo;t updated for several years (last commit 2015-08-07) I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect an early fix. Personally I will investigate for an alternative package or try to achieve the functionality with the newer ggplot2 capabilities.

Austria and Germany overlap with Austria being a few days ahead. Switzerland having twice the mortality. Summary Usefulness One can question the usefulness of such a visualization. It is hard to read the total number of cases from ternary plots. Situations with only single sick/deceased persons produce messy graphs. On the other hand it may help to see a pattern in the large scale. I also miss information about the relation to the total population.\nPossible Interpretations Besides the east Asian countries most of the world seems to just get started on infection. Their ternary plots are still very noisy. The currently 2nd and 3rd most infected countries Italy and Iran. Italy seems to be on an upward trajectory. Iran had similar behavior a few days ago but now seems back to a trajectory as China. Meanwhile the Chinese trajectory seems to head for its final position. In the Hubei where only few more infections come in it is possible to estimate the worst and best case from the figure. At the moment all momenta seem to be horizontal to the left. It will be interesting if any country will develop an upward momentum and what could be the reason. The current one in Italy might be rooted in some systematic problems. I\u0026rsquo;m considering doing another set of ternary plots comparing the total population, active and deceased ratios.\n","date":1584662400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584701732,"objectID":"a0a408f1d67dcd15cce503315495cb05","permalink":"/post/dev/datascience/corona/","publishdate":"2020-03-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/dev/datascience/corona/","section":"post","summary":"I found the inspiring post corona virus data.

I left my template alone for about a year and during this time I have developed some new practices and given up on some others.\nIn case you just got here: Cookiecutter is a templating system for programming projects. You find a template for your project and by calling cookiecutter templatename a project folder filled with filled templates is generated.\nR package structure I now try to stick closer to the R package folder structure. Although I am not working on packages this brings a few benefits. I can now use the functions provided by usethis and the devtools::load_all(). Mostly I use the load_all(). Before I had to source all my functions. Often this got in a tedious recursive task, or even worse I had to build a package just for the functions. The downside being I now need to manually create make rules to depend on the function definitions.\nA nice side effect of the package structure is that it now is easier to turn a project into a package. The greatest problem was to generate project slugs and folder names that will confirm Rs naming rules. This issue arises for more often for such projects. Often a dataset from a user comes in and it is not clear what to do with it. Too often I end up with a title something like \u0026ldquo;Usernames measurement of xy beginning of 2019\u0026rdquo;.\nFor now I sattle on a camel case format for the slug. The only snake case R would accept was with dots instead of the usual _. Using - was out of the question. Leaving it to the user to suggest naming if special characters need to be in the project name. Anyway it\u0026rsquo;s just about the slug - I don\u0026rsquo;t want to invest more time into it.\nFile organization I found it beneficial to work with lots of subfolders. My typical project I have lots of almost identical subreports - think about reports for each sub campaign within a study. The campaigns are similar, but often with a few adjustments - say adding a new sensor, extending the protocol, etc. The changes are simple enough so that they can be later aggregated, although almost every campaign has a spin that deserves a little subreport. A chore to come up with unique names for the produced files. Having it separated in one folder per subreport achieves the same.\nAs a side effect of using R package functions I now need to split my R code now into functions in the r directory that will get repeatedly sourced and scripts that will operate on input files.\nI still have not settled on the name of the folder for Rnw and Rmd files that generate the subreports. Using vignettes as for R packages does cause problems with the R functions for building vignettes.\nAutomatic dependencies I like to split my reports into multiple files. This makes my live easier as I need to worry less about leftover temporary variables and import of conflicting packages. In the Makefile this makes writing all dependencies down annoying. I\u0026rsquo;m working on ways to automate this. My aim is not to find a perfect solution. I doubt that is even possible with reasonable effort. Rather I want to automate away some of the most boring patterns.\nExample project I include a trivial example project so I can generate a little minimal working project as example. There were leftover mentions of the previous example project in the generated files. Don\u0026rsquo;t know how they stayed - but I hope now all of those are gone.\nThis used to be the tutorial of Kaggle working on a dataset of Titanic passengers. Turns out is locked away behind a login page that I didn\u0026rsquo;t see, and most annoyingly the data may only be downloaded by kaggle members. Since the tutorial didn\u0026rsquo;t matter I replaced it with something available under an open license and downloadable without registration. I chose a tutorial hosted by CERN.\nConclusion Well hope this template is also useful for you. I have some more strategies that I would like to have templated in there, but I am not sure yet how to tackle these.\n","date":1581411640,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583399885,"objectID":"35fcfa7685fcbb2dfdfc83eb06d0723b","permalink":"/post/dev/2020-01-cookiecutter/","publishdate":"2020-02-11T10:00:40+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/dev/2020-01-cookiecutter/","section":"post","summary":"Having some more time at hand I was able to add long overdue alterations to cookiecutter-r-data-analysis.

Also although it is under active development the documentation is difficult to read - many examples on the site are 5 years or older, which makes it difficult to realise which apply to the current version.

A novel approach to differentiate continuously the inhaled and exhaled breath acetone concentration signals is used. This leads to unprecedented fine grained data of inhaled and exhaled concentrations. The experimental results obtained are compared with those predicted using a simple three compartment model that theoretically describes the influence of inhaled concentrations on exhaled breath concentrations for volatile organic compounds with high blood:air partition coefficients, and hence appropriate for acetone. Good agreement between predicted and observed concentrations is obtained. Our results highlight that the influence of the upper airways cannot be neglected for volatiles with high blood:air partition coefficients.","tags":null,"title":"Effect of inhaled acetone concentrations on exhaled breath acetone concentrations at rest and during exercise","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["links"],"content":"There is a nice introducition to statistics with visualisation of the concepts at seeing theory\nTakes about 20 minutes to click through.\n","date":1545985906,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1550946549,"objectID":"bf0e07311f6b9c3070becbcdcb592700","permalink":"/post/links/seeing_statistics/","publishdate":"2018-12-28T09:31:46+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/links/seeing_statistics/","section":"post","summary":"There is a nice introducition to statistics with visualisation of the concepts at seeing theory\nTakes about 20 minutes to click through.\n","tags":["statistics","visualisation"],"title":"Seeing statistics","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["links"],"content":"There\u0026rsquo;s a fun video about a real-live Rube-Goldberg machine\n ","date":1542637372,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551912568,"objectID":"6ba2fe1f939a25eeed9577ff79df4af7","permalink":"/post/links/rubegoldberg/","publishdate":"2018-11-19T15:22:52+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/links/rubegoldberg/","section":"post","summary":"There\u0026rsquo;s a fun video about a real-live Rube-Goldberg machine\n ","tags":["fun"],"title":"Rubegoldberg","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["dev"],"content":"Just recently got my hand on Crossover.

I had already ignored the public directory, and had to delete the original master from online and recreate it empty - but I think one can streamline that. Then added the master using worktree in public: git worktree add -B master public origin/master the url in config.toml should be https://username.github.io/ - notice the trailing slash. I can then use the hugo command to build my site. And publish using cd public; git add . ; git commit -am pub; git push; cd .. - I\u0026rsquo;m in fish - many others use \u0026amp;\u0026amp; instead.

These techniques have opened up new and exciting possibilities for applied areas of research with applications to health, food science, the environment and security. Among these is the potential to use the trace volatiles in human breath, emitted from the skin and present in bodily fluids for diagnosing and monitoring diseases, monitoring treatments and examining health in general. This is possible because these volatiles provide a non-invasive window to physiological and metabolic processes occurring within the body. The research being undertaken at the Institute for Breath Research in Dornbirn, Austria is addressing the many current challenges of applying soft chemical ionization mass spectrometry for the analysis of the human volatilome for the benefit of clinical non-invasive diagnostic procedures; including sampling protocols and importantly the assignment of compounds with a high specificity. The unambiguous identification of volatile compounds is needed to provide the necessary information for the development of sensors for the detection of specific compounds for a given clinical application. Although the main focus of this paper will be on our breath analysis research in the health sciences, details of related projects in homeland security and search and rescue operations, namely those involved in discovering humans trapped in buildings or hiding in containers through the volatiles that people emit, are presented.","tags":["Breath Analysis","Breath Sampling","IMS","qualityAssured"],"title":"Applications of Soft Chemical Ionisation Mass Spectrometric Instrumentation to Investigate the Human Volatilome for use in the Medical Sciences","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pawel Mochalski","Marcis Leja","Evita Gasenko","Roberts Skapars","Daiga Santare","Armands Sivins","Dan Erik Aronsson","Clemens Ager","Carsten Jaeschke","Gidi Shani","Jan Mitrovics","Christopher A.

This has the nice benefit of assuring numbers that are close to each other stay close in two dimensions as well. Unfortunately the opposite does not hold. Conveniently a function to produce a hilbert curve is provided via HilbertVis on bioconductor.\nPTR-MS spectra I have been playing with PTR-MS data for some while. It\u0026rsquo;s always hard to visualize this datasets. There are some nice patterns showing up - isotopic and due to hydratization.\ndata I will not show out reading out the data - it was collected using a Ionicon PTR-TOF MS which requires tedious preprocessing - most of which I can finally do in R but the code is poorly documented so far. The measurment is actually from a proband who took a sip of ethanol a few minutes before measurement.\nJust a glimpse of it looks like this:\n   mass counts     21 142720   22 18708   23 8148   24 7137   25 6711   26 6468    Experiments Since over m/z 100 there is only sparse signal I created the relevant Hilbert curve doing\nCurves The first plot uses scales the area of the dots at the masses to the observed counts.\nThis plot shows a little structure - the main blocks are of 16 numbers.\n The numbers 1 to 16 are basically zero as there are no protonated ions at such masses. The next block contains the major precursors - the hydronium ion \\(H_3O^+\\) with its isotopes at m/z 19 to 21, \\(NO^+\\) at 30 and \\(O_2^+\\) at 32. A little visible is ammonia at m/z 18. The block from 33 to 48 contains the Zundel ion (\\(H_2O \\cdot H_3O^+\\) ) as well as ethanol at 47 (with some isotops at 48) and its metabolite acetaldehyde at 45. Following block contains the important compound acetone at 59 and not visible the next metabolite of ethanol acetic acid at 61. Next block contains isoprene at 69 as well as hydrated ethanol ion at 65. The following blocks show no visible ions although at aromatics like toluene (m/z 93) should show up there.  Unfortunately when observed on the PTR-TOF it can be seen that the signal is saturated at m/z 19, 37 and 47. So lets scale down the max signal.\nThe concentration of the observed compounds is in the ppm\u0026rsquo;s. Finally we see a little more. But still only compounds that occur in\nconcentrations of several ppbs.\nLets try to use logarithmic scale instead.\nNow the plot shows many more compounds. All the main ions are tailed by some ions of their isotopes. Though it is still hard to see where some traces occur. I experimentd with some zooming but overall there was little benefit to it. My next try will be to see if I can create an animated version of this to follow a volunteers breath pattern.\nThe code for this page was written in R. I will keep investigating and probably put a link to the git repo online once it reaches a more mature state.\n","date":1459296000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551867903,"objectID":"c2a999422ab76b6ddc8209241d6ece3f","permalink":"/post/2016/2016-01-hilbertptr/","publishdate":"2016-03-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2016/2016-01-hilbertptr/","section":"post","summary":"I saw some nice visualiztion for IP adresses which made use of the hilbert curve for mapping sequatial data into an area.
