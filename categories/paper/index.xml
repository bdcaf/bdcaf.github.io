(&amp;ldquo;Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Detect Acidic Volatiles Found in Human Odor Using the IR8a Pathway&amp;rdquo;, doi: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045"&gt;10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045&lt;/a&gt;).
It deals with how mosquitoes track their human targets. They identify three ranges - at furthest they track by CO2, in mid-range by IR and at closest they zoom in on particular VOCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m working on project &lt;a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/projects/kiras/kiras-2016.html"&gt;KIRAS&lt;/a&gt; now for some time, and we essentially also need to track humans. It seems our machine learning algorithm has a similar approach (although we do not use IR). But CO2 is more dominant in large containers, while in smaller other compounds play greater role.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
