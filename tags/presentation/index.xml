Keynote&lt;/a&gt; to convert a tex presentation for convenient presenting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did have a presentation on my PhDs topic last week. Took me some
collecting data from recent paper drafts and old slides to create
something polished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you would expect I prepared the presentation in &lt;a href="https://github.com/josephwright/beamer"&gt;beamer latex&lt;/a&gt;. I found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme"&gt;metropolis template&lt;/a&gt; to my liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great was my shock as the slides would show up blurry in full screen -
well for the first second - and then &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo; to nicely rendered. I
tried in Preview as well as Skim. They would render nicely but still
slow in Acrobat Reader - however I don&amp;rsquo;t like that one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the last day I found my lifesaver: &lt;a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html"&gt;PDF to
Keynote&lt;/a&gt;.
Not only would it transfer my slides into sharp images, I then could
also use the fancy Keynote controls and the moderator screen for
notes.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
