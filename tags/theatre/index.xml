venice. The shit faced spin seemed like a good idea. It means one of
the main actors had to drink before and during the show and was given
some leeway in their role. There is a mistress of ceremony that
provides the actor some drinks during the show and takes care things
don&amp;rsquo;t go out of hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t play out that well. A little slapstick was fun. Humour is
more than cursing on stage - it just is not that outstanding - maybe
for Americans. Anyway the fooling around and raunchy got boring
quickly. The play itself is a bit of a complicated choice - being so
anti-Semitic. They always stayed on the political correct side
though. I just was hoping on a more modern interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Play aftermath</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/2017/2017-07-17_keep_the/</link><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2017 09:38:09 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/2017/2017-07-17_keep_the/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Finally have seen it. Impressive what they did on the
stage. Not only a play, but they incorporated some stage
magic as well. They suggest strongly to #keepthesecret. I
can understand the show had more than one twist.&lt;/p&gt;
