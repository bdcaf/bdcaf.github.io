Just playing around with the idea of not using any external fonts. 

I have been putting off the redesign for some time now. 
With the recent development linking google fonts might be one thing to remove. 
This site wasn't that layout dependent anyway - so I suppose with a little nice CSS and maybe a few updated templates I might get around.
But I'm currently more worried about my vue apps and the Astro blog where I use the default style sheets.

Let me know if something breaks for you.
