The *Ig Nobel Price* winners have been [announced](https://www.improbable.com/2021/09/09/announcing-the-2021-ig-nobel-prize-winners/).
Although they are obscure this years nominees I didn't find them as funny as in the previous years. 

Nice to see that the chemistry one went to Wicker et.al. [(ref)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0203044)
We did similar measurements (though  not in the cinema).  So it's fun to see our field also got a nod.
