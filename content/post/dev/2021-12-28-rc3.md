The [#rc3](https://rc3.world/2021/public_fahrplan) is currently held. Luckily the talks are accessible without tickets.

Since it's all remote I didn't bother about a ticket. Though it would have been nice to see the 2d world they prepared for interaction.

So far the [make it static](https://media.ccc.de/v/rc3-2021-cwtv-343-make-it-static) talk was most interesting. I'm just toying with [astro](https://astro.build) - turning my AOC approach into [a nice blog](https://bdcaf.github.io/advent-of-code-2021/).

There's a lot of political talks - Assange and surveillance. Interesting to hear - though it feels just like last years.
