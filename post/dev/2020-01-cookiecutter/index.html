I left my template alone for about a year and during this time I have developed some new practices and given up on some others.</p><p>In case you just got here: <a href=https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>Cookiecutter</a> is a templating system for programming projects.
You find a template for your project and by calling <code>cookiecutter templatename</code> a project folder filled with filled templates is generated.</p><h2 id=r-package-structure>R package structure</h2><p>I now try to stick closer to the R package folder structure.
Although I am not working on packages this brings a few benefits.
I can now use the functions provided by <a href=https://usethis.r-lib.org/>usethis</a> and the <code>devtools::load_all()</code>.
Mostly I use the <code>load_all()</code>.
Before I had to source all my functions. Often this got in a tedious recursive task, or even worse I had to build a package just for the functions.
The downside being I now need to manually create make rules to depend on the function definitions.</p><p>A nice side effect of the package structure is that it now is easier to turn a project into a package.
The greatest problem was to generate project slugs and folder names that will confirm Rs naming rules.
This issue arises for more often for such projects. Often a dataset from a user comes in and it is not clear what to do with it.
Too often I end up with a title something like &ldquo;Usernames measurement of xy beginning of 2019&rdquo;.</p><p>For now I sattle on a camel case format for the slug.
The only snake case R would accept was with dots instead of the usual <code>_</code>.
Using <code>-</code> was out of the question.
Leaving it to the user to suggest naming if special characters need to be in the project name.
Anyway it&rsquo;s just about the slug - I don&rsquo;t want to invest more time into it.</p><h2 id=file-organization>File organization</h2><p>I found it beneficial to work with lots of subfolders.
My typical project I have lots of almost identical subreports - think about reports for each sub campaign within a study.
The campaigns are similar, but often with a few adjustments - say adding a new sensor, extending the protocol, etc.
The changes are simple enough so that they can be later aggregated, although almost every campaign has a spin that deserves a little subreport.
A chore to come up with unique names for the produced files.
Having it separated in one folder per subreport achieves the same.</p><p>As a side effect of using R package functions I now need to split my R code now into <em>functions</em> in the <code>r</code> directory that will get repeatedly sourced and <code>scripts</code> that will operate on input files.</p><p>I still have not settled on the name of the folder for <code>Rnw</code> and <code>Rmd</code> files that generate the subreports.
Using <code>vignettes</code> as for R packages does cause problems with the R functions for building vignettes.</p><h2 id=automatic-dependencies>Automatic dependencies</h2><p>I like to split my reports into multiple files.
This makes my live easier as I need to worry less about leftover temporary variables and import of conflicting packages.
In the Makefile this makes writing all dependencies down annoying.
I&rsquo;m working on ways to automate this.
My aim is not to find a perfect solution.
I doubt that is even possible with reasonable effort.
Rather I want to automate away some of the most boring patterns.</p><h2 id=example-project>Example project</h2><p>I include a trivial example project so I can generate a little minimal working project as example.
There were leftover mentions of the previous example project in the generated files.
Don&rsquo;t know how they stayed - but I hope now all of those are gone.</p><p>This used to be the tutorial of Kaggle working on a dataset of Titanic passengers. Turns out is locked away behind a login page that I didn&rsquo;t see, and most annoyingly the data may only be downloaded by kaggle members.
Since the tutorial didn&rsquo;t matter I replaced it with something available under an open license and downloadable without registration.
I chose a tutorial hosted by CERN.</p><h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Well hope this template is also useful for you.
I have some more strategies that I would like to have templated in there, but I am not sure yet how to tackle these.</p></div><footer class=post__footer><div class="post__tags tags clearfix"><svg class="tags__badge icon icon-tag" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path d="M32 19c0 1-1 2-1 2L21 31s-1 1-2 1-2-1-2-1L2 16c-1-1-1.4-2-1.4-2S0 12.5.0 11V3C0 1.5.8.8.8.8S1.5.0 3 0h8c1.5.0 3 .6 3 .6S15 1 16 2l15 15s1 1 1 2zM7 10a3 3 0 100-6 3 3 0 000 6z"/></svg><ul class=tags__list><li class=tags__item><a class="tags__link btn" href=/tags/cookiecutter/ rel=tag>cookiecutter</a></li></ul></div></footer></article></main></div></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__links><a class=footer__link href=/page/about/>About</a> | <a class=footer__link href=/page/contact/>Contact</a></div><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2021 Clemens Ager.
