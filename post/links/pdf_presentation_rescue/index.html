<meta property="og:description" content="(tldr;) use PDF to
Keynote to convert a tex presentation for convenient presenting.
I did have a presentation on my PhDs topic last week.  Took me some
collecting data from recent paper drafts and old slides to create
something polished.
As you would expect I prepared the presentation in beamer latex.  I found the metropolis template to my liking.
Great was my shock as the slides would show up blurry in full screen -
well for the first second - and then &ldquo;jump&rdquo; to nicely rendered.  I
tried in Preview as well as Skim. They would render nicely but still
slow in Acrobat Reader - however I don&rsquo;t like that one.
On the last day I found my lifesaver: PDF to
Keynote.
Not only would it transfer my slides into sharp images,  I then could
also use the fancy Keynote controls and the moderator screen for
notes.">
