my first attempt didn&rsquo;t work out so I quickly decided I wanted to go
with a &ldquo;maintained&rdquo; project.</p><p>So ultimately I ended at <a href=http://isync.sourceforge.net/>isync</a>.</p><p>Initial configurations that I frankensteined together didn&rsquo;t work
either so I had to go on debugging.</p><h3 id=certificate-woes>certificate woes</h3><p>I immediately got certificate errors. Even for google. In the
configuration the have a commented line for certificates in the home
directory. So I decided to get them for myself. Since I am behind
the universities firewall in the same subnet as the mail servers I was
not to worried that someone might MITM me bad certs.</p><p>In short I used</p><pre tabindex=0><code>[~]$ openssl s_client -connect mailserver.uni.ac.at:993 -showcerts &gt; crt
</code></pre><p>to download them. Basically I replace mailserver.uni.ac.at with my
servers. Then I used trusty old vim to cut the blocks from
<code>-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----</code> down to <code>-----END CERTIFICATE-----</code>
(including those lines) into individual files which I named based on
the identification before the blocks.</p><h3 id=passwords>passwords</h3><p>Along with this certificate issues I noticed that passwords often are
put in plain text in the config files. An absolute no-go for me. I
quickly discovered <a href=https://www.passwordstore.org/>pass</a> which uses
gpg to encrypt them.</p><p>Sure still worried as these are then passed around in plain text - but
at least I will not have them in my repositories on github.</p><h3 id=oh-gmail>oh gmail</h3><p>since most tutorials explicitely explain how to set up gmail I was
confused why it just wouldn&rsquo;t work for me!
It just wouldn&rsquo;t accept the password. After long and useless research
I recalled something was changed by google. You can now <a href=https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833>create
passwords for less secure
apps</a> - and that
was it. All I had to do was create an app password on the linked
site. Nice - so now even in the encrypted store is my google password
and I can easily delete the one for the app.</p><h3 id=final-config>final config</h3><p>so this is what is in my <code>.mbsyncrc</code>. I don&rsquo;t want to post it as big
text block as one needs to fill in the values that fit ones setup.</p><h5 id=accounts>accounts</h5><pre tabindex=0><code>IMAPAccount uibk
