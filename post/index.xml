Thanks to Julian King for pointing to this article.
It&amp;rsquo;s a interesting study trying to track down the endogenous origin of isoprene in breath.
Isoprene - usually - the second most abundant volatile organic compound in breath. Only acetone is more abundant. And King et. al. have discovered it shows interesting temporal dependence on physical exercise.</description></item><item><title>TidyTuesday Measles Vaccination Data</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/dev/tidytuesday/td20200225/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/dev/tidytuesday/td20200225/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a Github repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/bdcaf/td20200225">td20200225&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>This is a template for the hugo static site engine. The purpose is to use its page bundle feature with generated content from R. There were small issues to make hugo write the relative URLs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also uses the &lt;a href="https://www.getpapercss.com">papercss&lt;/a> layout. It seems suitable for a private science blog as it reminds me on the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randall_Munroe">Randal Munroe&lt;/a>s XKCD style.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It feels like a powerful tool. However the long wait for rendering is annoying.&lt;br>
I particularly like the physics simulations.
As test I followed the this &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/YFmN7eTNfNw">tutorial&lt;/a>. Really simple - just the render took over an hour.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway enjoy some nice wood chipping.&lt;/p>

(&amp;ldquo;Aedes aegypti Mosquitoes Detect Acidic Volatiles Found in Human Odor Using the IR8a Pathway&amp;rdquo;, doi: &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045">10.1016/j.cub.2019.02.045&lt;/a>).
It deals with how mosquitoes track their human targets. They identify three ranges - at furthest they track by CO&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->, in mid-range by IR and at closest they zoom in on particular VOCs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m working on project &lt;a href="https://www.uibk.ac.at/breath-research/projects/kiras/kiras-2016.html">KIRAS&lt;/a> now for some time, and we essentially also need to track humans. It seems our machine learning algorithm has a similar approach (although we do not use IR). But CO&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->2&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --> is more dominant in large containers, while in smaller other compounds play greater role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pheromone</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/links/pheromone/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Mar 2019 08:48:56 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/links/pheromone/</guid><description>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;BBC in our time&amp;rdquo; had a good &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0002mdl">podcast about pheromones&lt;/a>. Too bad they don&amp;rsquo;t offer transcripts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Pheromones in breath would be most interesting however it is still in debate whether human pheromones exist at all.&lt;br>
But there was the discovery of rabbit mammary pheromone by &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01739">Schaal et al&lt;/a>. And the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2890510/">darcin pheromone in mice&lt;/a>.
I did learn that some animals also have another organ related to smell - the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vomeronasal_organ">vomeronasal organ (Jacobson&amp;rsquo;s organ)&lt;/a>. It seems to be also present in humans.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Unfortunately our tech still doesn&amp;rsquo;t perform to well at the relevant masses, though that is an most interesting research area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grid Layout for Site</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/site/2019_layout/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Feb 2019 21:07:24 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/site/2019_layout/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently some html and css videos caught my attention.

&lt;a href="https://getpublii.com/">publii&lt;/a> for building statical sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many people still use Wordpress and the like to publish their blog. I
don&amp;rsquo;t like Wordpress as it requires to run PHP on the server meaning
it offers a quite large attack surface.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I prefer the static site approach. This also allows to radically cut
down on JavaScript and other external resources and gives me
the peace of mind that I don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about updating a
Wordpress installation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However the tool of
my choice, &lt;a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo&lt;/a> is a bit technical. Now with
&lt;a href="https://getpublii.com/">publii&lt;/a> there is something that I might
suggest command line muggles.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Abandonware</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/links/abandonware/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Jun 2018 12:12:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/links/abandonware/</guid><description>&lt;p>Every now and then I look up the games from my past.

&lt;p>Recently he made a fantastic video about solving the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/2SUvWfNJSsM">towers of hanoi&lt;/a>. I did already know it is easy to spell out the solution in terms of recursion. However he showed some connection to binary and ternary numbers - which alone is funny.

&lt;p>I did have a presentation on my PhDs topic last week. Took me some
collecting data from recent paper drafts and old slides to create
something polished.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As you would expect I prepared the presentation in &lt;a href="https://github.com/josephwright/beamer">beamer latex&lt;/a>. I found the &lt;a href="https://github.com/matze/mtheme">metropolis template&lt;/a> to my liking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great was my shock as the slides would show up blurry in full screen -
well for the first second - and then &amp;ldquo;jump&amp;rdquo; to nicely rendered. I
tried in Preview as well as Skim. They would render nicely but still
slow in Acrobat Reader - however I don&amp;rsquo;t like that one.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On the last day I found my lifesaver: &lt;a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/~oneill/freesoftware/pdftokeynote.html">PDF to
Keynote&lt;/a>.
Not only would it transfer my slides into sharp images, I then could
also use the fancy Keynote controls and the moderator screen for
notes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Merchant of Venice</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/theatre/merchant-of-venice/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 May 2018 12:38:11 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/theatre/merchant-of-venice/</guid><description>&lt;p>These days I saw the &lt;a href="https://www.shit-facedshakespeare.com">shitfaced shakespeares&lt;/a> merchant of
venice. The shit faced spin seemed like a good idea. It means one of
the main actors had to drink before and during the show and was given
some leeway in their role. There is a mistress of ceremony that
provides the actor some drinks during the show and takes care things
don&amp;rsquo;t go out of hand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It didn&amp;rsquo;t play out that well. A little slapstick was fun. Humour is
more than cursing on stage - it just is not that outstanding - maybe
for Americans. Anyway the fooling around and raunchy got boring
quickly. The play itself is a bit of a complicated choice - being so
anti-Semitic. They always stayed on the political correct side
though. I just was hoping on a more modern interpretation.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2018 Life Science Meeting</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/academic/2018-live-science/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Apr 2018 12:45:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/academic/2018-live-science/</guid><description>&lt;p>I will present a poster there.

It is a space game where you construct your own vehicles and explore the solar system. As physics games go it is amazing.
Unless you carefully plan out maneuvers they will lead to disaster - which is often also hilarious to watch play out. Even getting into orbit is a challenge in the beginning.
My first Mun landing without breaking stuff. The only critic point would be that one needs to learn about most concepts outside the game.</description></item><item><title>Vim builtin package manger</title><link>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/todayilearnt/vimpackage/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Jan 2018 09:33:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://bdcaf.github.io/post/todayilearnt/vimpackage/</guid><description>I was using dein package manager for some time happily.

The whole idea of censoring values below LOQ was already debunked by Currie.
